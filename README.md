# The Economics of Going Electric in California: From Gas to Grid in 2025

### Background

This project models the residential costs of increasing household electrification in California as of May 2025. It is funded by the California Climate Action Initiative and the research is undertaken at UC Berkeley's Energy and Resources Group in the Energy, Modeling, Analysis and Control lab.

Costs of electrifying, and adopting solar and storage, are presented for each county for single-family detached homes, with utility tariffs from PG&E, SCE, and SDG&E. Electricity costs, gas costs, and capital costs are all considered. For instance, if a gas stove is replaced by an induction stove, the decrease in gas costs, along with the injection of capital cost, and the changes in the energy bill due to the increased electricity consumption are all considered.
